## Kiwi store
Kiwi Store is a full-stack e-commerce application that leverages modern web development technologies to provide an intuitive and seamless shopping experience for its users. The application is built using React, a popular front-end library for building user interfaces, and Redux, a state management library that helps to manage complex data flows in the application.

In terms of styling, Kiwi Store utilizes the Styled Component library, which is a CSS-in-JS library that allows developers to write CSS directly into their components, providing greater control and flexibility over the styling of the application.

On the back-end, the application is powered by Node.js APIs built using the Express framework, which provides a fast and flexible way to build server-side applications. To interact with the database, Kiwi Store uses Mongoose, a powerful ORM for MongoDB that simplifies the process of working with data in a Node.js application.

Overall, Kiwi Store is a robust and scalable e-commerce application that leverages modern web development technologies to provide a fast, responsive, and user-friendly shopping experience. Whether you are a first-time user or a seasoned shopper, Kiwi Store is designed to provide a seamless experience that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations.
